  abstract = {Modified Rodrigues parameters (MRPs) are triplets in R3 bijectively and rationally mapped to quaternions through stereographic projection. We present here a compelling case for MRPs as a minimal degree-of-freedom parameterization of orientation through novel solutions to prominent problems in the fields of 3D vision and computer graphics. In our primary contribution, we show that the derivatives of a unit quaternion in terms of its MRPs are simple polynomial expressions of its scalar and vector part. Furthermore, we show that updates to unit quaternions from perturbations in parameter space can be computed without explicitly invoking the parameters in the computations. Based on the former, we introduce a novel approach for designing orientation splines by configuring their backprojections in 3D space. Finally, in the general topic of nonlinear optimization for geometric vision, we run performance analyses and provide comparisons on the convergence behavior of MRP parameterizations on the tasks of absolute orientation, exterior orientation and large-scale bundle adjustment of public datasets.},

The problem is formulated directly as a discrete time optimization problem using a Lie group variational integrator. Discrete time necessary conditions for optimality are derived, and an efficient computational approach is proposed to solve the resulting two-point boundary-value problem. This formulation wherein the optimal control problem is solved based on discretization of the attitude dynamics and derivation of discrete time necessary conditions, rather than development and discretization of continuous time necessary conditions, is shown to have significant advantages. In particular, the use of geometrically exact computations on SO(3) guarantees that this optimal control approach has excellent convergence properties even for highly nonlinear large angle attitude maneuvers.},

Specifically, we derive control laws (both in open-loop and closed-loop form) to maneuver the spacecraft between two given rotational states in finite time. The laws are such that a cost functional measuring the overall angular velocity during the spacecraft's motion is minimized. They do not require recourse to numerical methods and hence can be easily implemented in an on-board attitude control system. After dealing with a three-axis controlled spacecraft we also discuss the case that only torques about two principal axes of an axisymmetric spacecraft can be exerted.},

The cost to be minimized is the external torque applied to move the rigid body from an initial condition to a pre-specified terminal condition. Instead of discretizing the equations of motion, we use the discrete equations obtained from the discrete Lagrange-d'Alembert principle, a process that better approximates the equations of motion. Within the discrete-time setting, these two approaches are not equivalent in general. The kinematics are discretized using a natural Lie-algebraic formulation that guarantees that the flow remains on the Lie group SO(3) and its algebra so(3).

The main idea is to define a functional depending on velocity or its derivatives that measures smoothness of trajectories and find a trajectory that minimizes this functional. In order to ensure that the computed trajectories are independent of the parametrization of positions and orientations, we use the notions of Riemannian metric and covariant derivative from differential geometry and formulate the problem as a variational problem on the Lie group of spatial rigid body displacements. We show that by choosing an appropriate measure of smoothness, the trajectories can be made to satisfy boundary conditions on the velocities or higher order derivatives. Dynamically smooth trajectories can be obtained by incorporating the inertia of the system into the definition of the Riemannian metric. We state the necessary conditions for the shortest distance, minimum acceleration and minimum jerk trajectories.},

Recent approaches have sought to plan, control, and execute maneuvers with large, yet deliberate, load swings for more agile, energy-optimal maneuvering. Unfortunately, the system's nonlinear dynamics make executing such trajectories a significant challenge and experimental demonstrations thus far have relied completely on a motion capture system and non-negligible simplifications like restriction of the system to a two-dimensional workspace or closing of the control loop on the quadrotor, instead of the payload. In this work, we observe the payload using a downward-facing camera and estimate its state relative to the quadrotor using an extended Kalman filter. We demonstrate closed-loop payload control in the full three-dimensional workspace, with the planning, estimation, and control pipeline implemented on an onboard processor. We show control of load swings up to 53o from the vertical axis. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first realization of closed-loop control of agile slung-load maneuvers and the largest achieved payload angle.},

  abstract = {This paper provides new results for a robust adaptive tracking control of the attitude dynamics of a rigid body. Both of the attitude dynamics and the proposed control system are globally expressed on the special orthogonal group, to avoid complexities and ambiguities associated with other attitude representations such as Euler angles or quaternions. By designing an adaptive law for the inertia matrix of a rigid body, the proposed control system can asymptotically follow an attitude command without the knowledge of the inertia matrix, and it is extended to guarantee boundedness of tracking errors in the presence of unstructured disturbances. These are illustrated by numerical examples and experiments for the attitude dynamics of a quadrotor UAV.},

The contribution of this paper is that two fundamental stabilization problems for the inverted 3-D pendulum are posed and solved. The first problem, asymptotic stabilization of a specified equilibrium in the inverted equilibrium manifold, is solved using smooth and globally defined feedback of angular velocity and attitude of the 3-D pendulum. The second problem, asymptotic stabilization of the inverted equilibrium manifold, is solved using smooth and globally defined feedback of angular velocity and a reduced attitude vector of the 3-D pendulum. These control problems for the 3-D pendulum exemplify attitude stabilization problems on the configuration manifold SO(3) in the presence of potential forces.

These maneuvers involve well-coordinated and highly-coupled motions of the entire fleet of spacecraft while satisfying an arbitrary number of constraints. This problem is complicated by the nonlinearity of the attitude dynamics, the non-convexity of some of the constraints, and the coupling that exists in some of the constraints between the positions and attitudes of all spacecraft. While there has been significant research to solve for the translation and/or rotation trajectories for the multiple spacecraft reconfiguration problem, the approach presented in this paper is more general and on a larger scale than the problems considered previously. The essential feature of the solution approach is the separation into two stages, the first using a simplified planning approach to obtain a feasible solution, which is then significantly improved using a smoothing stage. The first stage is solved using a bidirectional Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) planner. Then the second step optimizes the trajectories by solving an optimal control problem using the Gauss pseudospectral method (GPM). Several examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach for designing spacecraft reconfiguration maneuvers.},

  abstract = {The thesis presents a two-stage approach for designing optimal reconfiguration maneuvers for multiple spacecraft. These maneuvers involve well-coordinated and highlycoupled motions of the entire fleet of spacecraft while satisfying an arbitrary number of constraints. This problem is particularly difficult because of the nonlinearity of the attitude dynamics, the non-convexity of some of the constraints, and the coupling between the positions and attitudes of all spacecraft. As a result, the trajectory design must be solved as a single 6N DOF problem instead of N separate 6 DOF problems. The first stage of the solution approach quickly provides a feasible initial solution by solving a simplified version without differential constraints using a bidirectional Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) planner. A transition algorithm then augments this guess with feasible dynamics that are propagated from the beginning to the end of the trajectory. The resulting output is a feasible initial guess to the complete optimal control problem that is discretized in the second stage using a Gauss pseudospectral method (GPM) and solved using an off-the-shelf nonlinear solver. This thesis also places emphasis on the importance of the initialization step in pseudospectral methods in order to decrease their computation times. It demonstrates the improvement that an initial guess based on an RRT planner brings to an optimal control problem solved using pseudospectral methods. Finally, this thesis presents the successful results of several reconfiguration maneuver experiments performed using the Synchronized Position Hold Engage and Reorient Experimental Satellites (SPHERES) hardware testbed onboard the International Space Station (ISS). The maneuvers were designed using two different two-stage algorithms presented in this work. It also discusses the lessons learnt from these tests, and the recommendations to improve future ISS reconfiguration experiments.},

This paper presents a solution using a B-spline parameterization of rotations. The method allows for a continuous interpolation and approximation through a given set of quaternions up to a specified order. The algorithm resembles the well-known B-spline interpolation in the sense that it boils down to solving a system of linear equations.

In particular, sampling-based motion planning algorithms typically require a distance metric defined on the configuration space, a sampling function, and a method for interpolating sampled points.

Defining proper metrics, sampling, and interpolation techniques for SE(3) is not obvious, and can become a hidden source of failure for many planning algorithm implementations. This paper examines some of these issues and presents techniques which have been found to be effective experimentally for Rigid Body path planning.},

We prove that there is a unique symmetric connection with this property. Furthermore, we show that there is a family of Riemannian metrics that are compatible with such a connection.

Solutions typically require the calculation of the gradient and Hessian. However, real functions of quaternion variables are essentially nonanalytic, which are prohibitive to the development of quaternion-valued learning systems. To address this issue, we propose new definitions of quaternion gradient and Hessian, based on the novel generalized Hamilton-real (GHR) calculus, thus making a possible efficient derivation of general optimization algorithms directly in the quaternion field, rather than using the isomorphism with the real domain, as is current practice. In addition, unlike the existing quaternion gradients, the GHR calculus allows for the product and chain rule, and for a one-to-one correspondence of the novel quaternion gradient and Hessian with their real counterparts. Properties of the quaternion gradient and Hessian relevant to numerical applications are also introduced, opening a new avenue of research in quaternion optimization and greatly simplified the derivations of learning algorithms. The proposed GHR calculus is shown to yield the same generic algorithm forms as the corresponding real- and complex-valued algorithms. Advantages of the proposed framework are illuminated over illustrative simulations in quaternion signal processing and neural networks.},

The effect of asymptotically decaying disturbances on system trajectories is also examined. To demonstrate the applicability of iSAC to a variety of systems and conditions, we employ five different systems, including a 13-dimensional quaternionbased quadrotor. Each system is tested in different scenarios, ranging from feasible and infeasible trajectory tracking, to setpoint stabilization, with or without the presence of external disturbances.

In contrast to existing feedback controllers, our approach poses the nonconvex constrained nonlinear optimization problem as the tracking of a desired negative mode insertion gradient on the configuration space of a Lie group. This results in a closed-form feedback control law even with input saturation and thus is well suited for online application. In extending SAC to Lie groups, the associated mode insertion gradient is derived and the switching time optimization on Lie groups is studied. We demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of our approach in the 2D kinematic car on SE(2) and the 3D quadrotor on SE(3). We also implement iLQG on a quadrator model and compare to SAC, demonstrating that SAC is both faster to compute and has a larger basin of attraction.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an iterative linear quadratic regulator (iLQR) optimal controller of a high level dynamic model using Euler-Lagrange equations for a single quadrotor UAV with a cable-suspended heavy rigid body. The control algorithm is constructed in order to improve two possible outputs: firstly, precisely tracking a given desired trajectory for a quadrotor with load, and, secondly, considering an anti-swing load through a transporting task. Two challenges have been taken into account: aggressive trajectory tracking and stability in behaviour; these must be guaranteed for the full UAV carrying the payload. The high nonlinear dynamic model of the quadrotor with a consiseration of the cable suspended payload is represented in eleven degrees of freedom. Subsequently, the nonlinear dynamic model is linearised in two modes, a vehicle mode without a load effect during a taking-off task and a switching-to-quad-load system mode considering the load effect used in a simulation. The simulation results are presented to illustrate the system stability improvement and precise implementation through verifying the ILQR parameters in comparison with the LQR controller.},

  title = {Unified Motion Control for Dynamic Quadrotor Maneuvers Demonstrated on Slung Load and Rotor Failure Tasks},
  isbn = {978-1-4799-6923-4},
  abstract = {In recent years impressive results have been presented illustrating the potential of quadrotors to solve challenging tasks. Generally, the derivation of the controllers involve complex analytical manipulation of the dynamics and are very specific to the task at hand. In addition, most approaches construct a trajectory and then design a stabilizing controller in a separate step, whereas a fully optimal solution requires finding both simultaneously. In this paper, a generalized approach is presented using an iterative optimal control algorithm. A series of complex tasks are thus solved using the same algorithm without the need for manual manipulation of the system dynamics, heuristic simplifications, or manual trajectory generation. First, aggressive maneuvers are performed by requiring the quadrotor to pass with a slung load through a window not high enough for the load to pass while hanging straight down. Second, go-to-goal tasks with single and double rotor failure are demonstrated. The adaptability and applicability of this unified approach to such diverse tasks with a nonlinear, underactuated, constrained, and in the case of the slung load, hybrid quadrotor systems is thus shown.},

  issn = {null},
  abstract = {The recent work on quadrotor have focused on more and more challenging tasks with increasingly complex systems. Systems are often augmented with slung loads, inverted pendulums or arms, and accomplish complex tasks such as going through a window, grasping, throwing and catching. Usually, controllers are designed to accomplish a specific task on a specific system using analytic solutions, so each application needs long preparations. On the other hand, the direct multiple shooting approach is able to solve complex problems without any analytic development, by using off-the-shelf optimization solver. In this paper, we show that this approach is able to solve a wide range of problems relevant to quadrotor systems, from on-line trajectory generation for quadrotors to going through a window for a quadrotor-and-pendulum system, through manipulation tasks for a aerial manipulator.},

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with optimal trajectory generation for robotic multi-body systems. The focus is on discrete optimal control methods which operate intrinsically in the state space system manifold and do not require coordinate charts or projections. This is accomplished by defining both the dynamics and the optimal control solution as sequences of vector fields mapping to curves on the Lie group through retraction maps, and defining variations and differentiation with respect to such vector fields. As a result, standard trajectory optimization methods can be easily extended to the Lie group setting without loss of efficiency. The methods are illustrated with three numerical examples: a quadrotor, an aerial vehicle with manipulators, and a simple nonholonomic system.},

Heuristics are also considered that allow faster performance. This method has been implemented in the IPOPT code, which we demonstrate in a detailed numerical study based on 954 problems from the CUTEr test set. An evaluation is made of several line-search options, and a comparison is provided with two state-of-the-art interior-point codes for nonlinear programming.},
